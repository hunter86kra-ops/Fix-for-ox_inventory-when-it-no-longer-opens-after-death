The script is a fix for visn_are when you use ox_inventory and it doesn’t work anymore after dying. You can also just leave out visn_are and use other scripts.

The script works like this: in visn_are, the command revive must be active because you need /revive from visn_are and the command from the script /inv so that ox_inventory works again. So, first, reviving via tx works, then the command /inv on the person should fix the problem when reviving.
